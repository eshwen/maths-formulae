# maths-formulae

A booklet summarising mathematical formulae and identities at school- and university-level.

Compile with

```sh
latexmk -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -pdf main.tex
```

TODO: Add better documentation, perhaps with MkDocs where I can add interactive plots with `plotly`. Or just convert the entire doc from LaTeX to MkDocs.
